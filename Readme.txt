Language Understanding and Question Answering System using Jeopardy! Dataset

Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for building a language understanding and question answering system using the Jeopardy! dataset. The project aims to train a language understanding model to extract meaning from open-ended questions and leverage that understanding to answer the questions using a dedicated QA system.

Motivation
The main motivation behind this project is to advance the capabilities of Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems and improve human-computer interaction. By developing a robust language understanding and question answering system, we aim to enhance user experiences, increase efficiency, and unlock new opportunities for automation and innovation across various industries.

Significance
A successful language understanding and question answering system has various potential applications, including customer support automation, information retrieval, educational platforms, and conversational agents. By enabling machines to understand and respond to human language more effectively, we can democratize information access, bridge gaps in knowledge, and empower individuals to make informed decisions.

Objectives
Train a language understanding model to comprehend the semantics and context of open-ended questions.
Develop a dedicated question answering system that leverages the understanding generated by the language model.
Evaluate the performance of the integrated system on various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Provide comprehensive documentation and guidelines for deploying and using the system in real-world applications.
Features
Fine-tuned pre-trained language models such as BERT, RoBERTa, or DistilBERT on the Jeopardy! dataset for language understanding.
Developed a question answering system based on pre-trained QA models like BERT-QA or RoBERTa-QA.
Integrated the language understanding model with the QA system to create a cohesive pipeline.
Deployed the integrated system and provided documentation for its usage.

Dataset
The Jeopardy! dataset consists of approximately 200,000 rows of question-answer pairs collected from the American Quiz Show Jeopardy!. Each row contains a question and its corresponding answer, providing a rich and diverse source of data for training and evaluating the language understanding and question answering system.
